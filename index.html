           <p id="atinfo"> Attendance box is a box for reducing absence at school for students, and also prevent safety for all the students for their school weekday. The attendance box will give a better overview of who come to school and who don’t. 
            It will work in this way: students have to meet up physically at school to unlock their locker to confirm that they have been to school, and this is because that attendance box must be dissolved by a personal key – that you have to insert into your “representative” locker. For each time you are twisting your key a new ball will fall down, and represent number of days you have been at school. (but it is not possible to dissolve several times in one day, as the box will close and be locked for 12-24 hours automatically after u have unlocked a day!) 
            At the end of the month, the number of balls will be read out by the teacher, written down and further sent to the management to document attendance in the database. If a student should not show up, this will be easier documented than by a call out the students and other methods as these ancient methods can easily be cheated by through cooperation between students etc. AB forces will significantly strengthen attendance at school and the safety network to both parents, students and school. </p>

        <p>Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic children are more absence at school which makes it harder to track attendance. We saw this as a major problem and wanted to address the thematic. Thus, we proudly present you the solution: <br> <br> <b><i> “Attendance box is a simple and efficient tool to further engage school attendance and prevent absences”</i></b></p>
